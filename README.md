# Multivariable Gradient Descent

## Overview
This repository implements the **Multivariable Gradient Descent** algorithm, an optimization technique used to minimize a multivariable function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent. It is a core method in machine learning, used for training models and optimizing cost functions with respect to multiple variables.

## Problem Addressed
The algorithm is designed to find the local minimum of a multivariable function. It can be applied to various fields such as machine learning, physics simulations, and economics, where functions depend on several variables.

## Implementation
The implementation is provided in the following programming languages:
- **C++**
- **Python**
- **Java**
- **MATLAB**
- **R**
- **Ruby**

Each version is independent and can be used according to the language preference.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SudeErzurumlu/multivariable-gradient-descent.git
   ```
2. Choose the desired language folder, and navigate to it.
3. Run the code using the respective language's command (e.g., python gradient_descent.py, java GradientDescent.java, etc.).
